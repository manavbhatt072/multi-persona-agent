## 🌟 Why This Project Wins
This isn't just another chatbot. It's a **sophisticated decision-making engine** that mimics a real-world executive council. It features:
1.  **Dynamic Routing**: It doesn't just run everyone. It *thinks* about who is needed (e.g., calling the "Creative Thinker" only for abstract ideas).
2.  **Real-Time Intelligence**: It searches the *live web* for market data—no hallucinations.
3.  **Conflict Synthesis**: It forces diverse personas (Optimist vs. Critic) to debate until a consensus is reached.
4.  **🎙️ Podcast Mode**: It automatically converts the boring text plan into a **fun, 2-minute audio script** ready for production.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🚦 Dynamic Persona Router
The system analyzes your prompt keywords to assemble the perfect team:
-   **Core Team (Always Active)**: `Analyst` 📈, `Critic` 🛑, `Optimist` ✨.
-   **Creative Trigger**: Adds `Creative Thinker` 🎨 if you ask for "ideas", "abstract", or "new names".
-   **Expert Trigger**: Adds `Domain Expert` 🛠️ if you ask for "market", "cost", or "industry" data.

### 2. 🌐 Real-Time Web Search
The **Domain Expert** is equipped with `DuckDuckGo Search`.
-   *Competitors*: Use static/fake data.
-   *This Agent*: Fetches **live 2024/2025 market trends**, risk factors, and competitor analysis.

### 3. ⚖️ The Mediator (Consensus Engine)
A specialized `Gemini-1.5-Pro` agent that acts as the CEO.
-   **Strict Output Format**: It refuses to output generic text. It *must* produce:
    1.  **Risk & Regret Analysis** (Top 2 Risks + Mitigations)
    2.  **Strategic Consensus** (Where the Optimist & Critic agree)
    3.  **5-Step Action Plan** (With Owners & Deadlines)

### 4. 🎙️ Podcast Mode
After the plan is finalized, the **Podcaster Agent** takes over.
-   It writes a witty, engaging script between a Host, an Expert, and a Creative Guest.
-   Perfect for turning dry reports into consumable audio content.
